This is an how-to to illustrate the steps needed for producing signal scans, from the production of datacards until the visualization of the
final 2D plot.

0) Produce the mca file containing the desired signal and systematics variations:
   - go inside create_mca/
   - edit the replace_strings.sh by specifying the input files
   according to the explanation in the file header

1) Copy the newly produced mca inside the susy-sos/ and modify the
sos_plot.py in the following way:
   - switch to dowhat = "limits"
   - replace PLOTandCUTS="susy-sos/<your_new_mca>.txt susy-sos/2los_tight.txt"

1a) Copy prepare_and_run_limits.sh into python/plotter
    Copy go.sh into python/plotter

2) Produce the datacards for a certain signal by modifying
prepare_and_run_limits.sh inside plotter/ specifying the type of
signal and the name of the directory you want to save the cards (see
the file header for details)

3) bash prepare_and_run_limits.sh

4) Once the script has finished to run, go inside the output dir
(output_scan_xxx/) where the cards for the signal poitns are produced
and do the merging part.

5) In order to do the merging, copy the set_combine.sh inside
output_scan_xxx/ and run the script (remember to adapt the dir in the script
where your CMSSW version for combine is located inside your local area).

6) once it's finished, hadd of the root files, i.e.
hadd higgsCombineTChiWZ.Asymptotic.FINAL.root sig_TN2C1*/*Asymptotic*.root

7) copy the file higgsCombineTChiWZ.Asymptotic.FINAL.root under
scan_plot/limits/ with an appropriate name which recalls how
it has been produced (like "[..]_final_Moriond17.root").

8) follow the instructions on scan_plot/README to produce
the final plot.
